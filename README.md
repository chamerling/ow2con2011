#OW2Con 2011 Demo

Contains all that is required for OW2Con 2011 talk and demo.

## Talk : Petals BPM and The Cloud

>All the services are moving to the Cloud, so are business processes. In this talk, we will show how to create collaborative business processes using an open source SaaS BPMN Editor. But designing business processes is not enough, why not running them in the Cloud? We will see that we can rely on a completely Cloud-aware SOA software infrastructure combining several open sources solutions such as a Service Bus and IaaS framework. The resulting ‘Cloud Service Bus’ allows the integration of in-house services in order to benefit from Cloud-based features such as elasticity, load balancing, service clustering and migration. This Cloud Service Bus will serve as the runtime basis of the business processes producing a Petals Cloud Stack solution. All in the Cloud, all open source!
